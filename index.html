          <p>As a young student, science always facinated me. I was curious to know about everything. I would
            embarass my mom by bending down in the middle of the road to observe the crawlies. I was well know in school for
            winning the title of best sports woman award for 4 consequtive years.

          <p>With clarity in my mind to pursue in the field of science I took up PCMB. Here, I discovered
            my passion for teaching. Almost everyday I used to get calls from my friends to learn the concepts that was taught
            in the day. This also helped me understand the subject better.

          <p>And here is my engineering journey in MIGHTY MIGHT MIT. I feel this was my drain period as I had
            too much expectations of the kind of work I would do. But ended up being slightly complacent.
